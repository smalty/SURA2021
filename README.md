# SURA2021

I worked with Professor Nynke Niezink from CMU in a program called Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship. The file ODE.rmd contains all the work on static network simulations using stochastic differential equations. The final report is a paper-like report that I submitted to the SURA program at CMU. The other files stu98, etc. are real public data and the source is mentioned in the final report.
